# TODOs

  - [ ] do we still want `clang-multilib`?
  - [ ] restore rocm...
    + or unify rocm?


  - [ ] auto updater stuff..


  - [ ] switch all to using `git` (commit)
  - [ ] bump all LLVM package sets to latest patch version.. (commit)
  - [ ] link changelogs in meta...

----

  - have the first commit be moving `llvm` to `llvm-old`
  - progressively build up `llvm` from there
  - once we reach parity, start making simplifying changes to both?
  - idea is that you can eval and compare the two at every commit...

  - alternatively: don't bother
